This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \\\\n\\', \\'Interviewee: Yes. Yes.\\\\n\\\\n\\'], [\"Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you\\'ve worked extensively on brand communication and content strategy development. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you tailored messaging for a startup client, and what key factors you considered in that process?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \\'Interviewee: I worked for a startup called Peacefully, which helps individuals work through end of life necessities and\\\\n\\\\n\\'], [\\'Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging but important project. How did you approach the tone and style of the messaging for Peacefully, considering the sensitive nature of the services they provide?  \\\\n\\\\n\\', \"Interviewee: Yeah. That was a that\\'s a great question. And I, uh, what we did was we focused on being we looked around, first of all, competitors and saw how, uh, the other businesses that were in the same space spoke because, uh, one way that we recognize to stand out was have distinction in our brand voice. And we recognized that there was, uh, a lot of coldness in their tone. So we really worked on being as empathetic as possible, especially as you mentioned given the sensitive nature of the work. And so we looked at every communication on Instagram, etcetera, and made sure that it sounded like a human being, and that it also sounded like it was, um, even though we were providing necessary information, it was put in such a way that it was considered of where a person may be in their life in terms of potentially having just experienced a loss.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s clear you put a lot of thought into that process. How did you measure the effectiveness of this new brand voice and messaging approach, particularly in terms of user engagement or feedback?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \\'Interviewee: Yeah. We primarily looked at reviews and actually we interfaced a lot with our, uh, with our client base because, essentially, we were pretty small and we and the first couple people who are using the platform were, um, were essentially the first. So we were able to communicate directly with them. Some of them we actually knew personally. And we got a lot of important feedback about how the flow of information and questions was designed. Uh, we and we we, uh, of course, we were cautious of the fact that the sample size was not huge and but we did insist that people were unsparing in their criticism and then we factored in their feedback. And as time went on and we got more and more feedback, we were then able to test the changes that we were making against, uh, how people were feeling about the content.\\\\n\\\\n\\'], [\"Interviewer: That\\'s a very hands-on and user-centric approach to feedback. Shifting focus a bit, I\\'d like to discuss your experience with SEO best practices. Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren\\'t really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook\\'s algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you\\'re essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you\\'d have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don\\'t know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one\\'s portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor\\'s pitch is that you don\\'t, um, you know, you don\\'t get get into a limousine with someone who\\'s never driven before, and if you\\'ve never driven before yourself, you don\\'t just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one\\'s home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I\\'m gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that\\'s all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors\\' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I\\'ve kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you\\'re working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it\\'s coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don\\'t wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content\\'s professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there\\'s a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren\\'t dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13. Uh, they could be sharing content on Facebook that was not just, hey, I\\'m a financial advisor, come talk to me, but was professional looking, um, and also, um, and also content that they could trust and that and that emphasize the right content goals, which is let\\'s just get people in the door and start having a conversation regardless of where they\\'re at in life, and especially if they\\'re at a turning point in life, like getting their first job, getting married, etcetera.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s interesting to see how the focus on user experience and trustworthiness extended to the platform\\'s design and functionality. Given the conservative nature of the target audience, how did you approach the content strategy to ensure it resonated with financial advisors and helped them achieve their business growth goals?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: That\\'s a great question. It was definitely something that we handled using, um, what what was happening at White Glove while I was there was we were leasing a a content platform, uh, that was widely used, um, and that we were paying a lot of money for, but that allowed advisers to share paywalled content, which was kind of the, uh, opportunity benefit that was being promoted to financial advisers and consequently to their clients, the type of people who, um, basically the incentive would be I\\'m gonna follow financial advisor x on Facebook because by doing so, I\\'ll be able to read stuff on Forbes and Barron\\'s, etcetera, uh, financial outlets that pay well their content. Bloomberg would be another example. Um, and we were getting away from that. We were we were having to do it ourselves. And so, um, so we we actually had an opportunity to spend 3 or 4 months surveying our current client base of financial advisors and asking them the type of content that they think would be good for their audience. Now we also recognize that they wouldn\\'t necessarily be the best judges of that. Um, for example, uh, we got a lot of feedback about not including or even bothering to write anything about cryptocurrency. That\\'s, you know, that\\'s it was a type of thing that, um, that financial advisers were tired of hearing about, but at the same time, from a from a conversion standpoint in terms of bringing in new clients, it tested extremely highly after the fact for being the type of thing that that people were actually coming in the door and talking about. And that became particularly true as time went on and as we have now reached the point where there are Bitcoin ETFs and soon to be ether ETFs. This is the type of thing that, um, that at least the younger client base of financial advisers work with are definitely interested in diversifying their portfolio and especially given the state of the market right now, uh, in terms of being at an all time high. So, um, so to some degree, we were able to, uh, modulate and control the type of content that financial advisers would see and particularly the stuff that they wouldn\\'t see, but it was also part of my job and our role as a company to convince them that the topics like LGBTQ would be another example that they might consider to be, um, outside of their purview and also potentially politically hazardous are also exactly the kind of things that a, get interest from people, and, b, may potentially grow a client base because, of course, with the younger generation, there are also more gay couples and things like that, and it\\'s and it\\'s financial advisers. Uh, once they use the platform would recognize that if they shared content about that, they could control who got to see it, um, and and and also who didn\\'t get to see it so that they could be less conservative in their approach.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s fascinating to see how you navigated the balance between the financial advisors\\' preferences and the actual audience engagement data. Given the success of introducing topics like cryptocurrency and LGBTQ finance, how did you measure the impact of these new content areas on the financial advisors\\' client acquisition and retention?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: That was just something that we would reach out, uh, after 6 months, uh, of being on the platform. Actually, we did a small survey at 3 months and then a bigger one at 6 months. And, uh, in addition to the daily feedback that we would be getting through private channels, things like emails and chat, etcetera, that we were, uh, that we were keeping in contact with financial advisers. But we also did a concerted survey to see how these people were feeling about their content. And then, um, and, of course, also ask them to rate the effectiveness of certain content. There were also it\\'s was not a huge client base of financial advisors, so it was the type of people that our account team regularly interface with. And I would say it was a priority of mine to, um, to route as many of those calls over to me as possible and or to be interacting with, uh, the 2 women who were in charge of the account base to hear the anecdotes about how certain content was performing and others not. Um, you know, the the there was never it was never surprised that backdoor Roth conversions were of interest to people, but, uh, it was it was, um, heartening to hear that, uh, social issues were driving as much of the conversation.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s clear you had a comprehensive approach to gathering feedback and measuring the impact of the content strategy. Given the success of this approach, how did you use these insights to further refine the content strategy and potentially explore new areas of focus for the financial advisors\\' platform?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, I think you just answered the question. We we I would say it\\'s not easy to say how we did that. Uh, that\\'s just what we did. I mean, we we would, um, we would continue to write about basic issues, but, um, I think we recognize that what is a Roth IRA was not the kind of thing that would get the same feedback as something that was a little more incendiary, especially given that we were using social media. So I would say, um, I actually think from the beginning, we bit off a lot of of, uh, news verticals and\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\\'Interviewer: It sounds like you were able to identify and leverage the power of engaging and sometimes controversial topics to drive engagement and conversation. Given this shift in strategy, how did you ensure that the content remained informative and valuable to the audience, even when discussing more incendiary topics?  \\\\n\\\\n\\', \"Interviewee: Well, I wouldn\\'t say we ever got 2 incendiary, but I would say that, uh, we we worked closely with a, uh, with a company that, um, uh, hired writers on someone\\'s behalf when you were in charge of a team, and they turned out the the you were able to work with the same writer. You didn\\'t get new ones all the time, so we were able to basically say, oh, this is our financial expert and they really get, uh, how we\\'re writing, uh, how we\\'re trying to write in a certain quasi journalistic tone, but but mostly on the informative side of things. And and then when we threw that person, um, a maybe more incendiary topic, and I don\\'t think we ever did anything too incendiary, they knew to write it in our kind of brand voice because that was what that company in particular specialized in. And then I was there as a final judge of whether, uh, the content was adhering to our copy and voice guidelines.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\\'Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

That was a that\\'s a great question. And I, uh, what we did was we focused on being we looked around, first of all, competitors and saw how, uh, the other businesses that were in the same space spoke because, uh, one way that we recognize to stand out was have distinction in our brand voice. And we recognized that there was, uh, a lot of coldness in their tone. So we really worked on being as empathetic as possible, especially as you mentioned given the sensitive nature of the work. And so we looked at every communication on Instagram, etcetera, and made sure that it sounded like a human being, and that it also sounded like it was, um, even though we were providing necessary information, it was put in such a way that it was considered of where a person may be in their life in terms of potentially having just experienced a loss.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s clear you put a lot of thought into that process. How did you measure the effectiveness of this new brand voice and messaging approach, particularly in terms of user engagement or feedback?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \\'Interviewee: Yeah. We primarily looked at reviews and actually we interfaced a lot with our, uh, with our client base because, essentially, we were pretty small and we and the first couple people who are using the platform were, um, were essentially the first. So we were able to communicate directly with them. Some of them we actually knew personally. And we got a lot of important feedback about how the flow of information and questions was designed. Uh, we and we we, uh, of course, we were cautious of the fact that the sample size was not huge and but we did insist that people were unsparing in their criticism and then we factored in their feedback. And as time went on and we got more and more feedback, we were then able to test the changes that we were making against, uh, how people were feeling about the content.\\\\n\\\\n\\'], [\"Interviewer: That\\'s a very hands-on and user-centric approach to feedback. Shifting focus a bit, I\\'d like to discuss your experience with SEO best practices. Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren\\'t really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook\\'s algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you\\'re essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you\\'d have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don\\'t know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one\\'s portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor\\'s pitch is that you don\\'t, um, you know, you don\\'t get get into a limousine with someone who\\'s never driven before, and if you\\'ve never driven before yourself, you don\\'t just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one\\'s home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I\\'m gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that\\'s all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors\\' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I\\'ve kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you\\'re working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it\\'s coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don\\'t wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\\\\n\\\\n\"], [\"Interviewer: It\\'s clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content\\'s professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \\\\n\\\\n\", \"Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there\\'s a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren\\'t dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13.
